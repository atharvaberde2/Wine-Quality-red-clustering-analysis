# Overview
In this project, clustering techniques are used to find patterns and groupings within wine quality data. This initiative aims to categorize wines into discrete quality clusters by examining their numerous chemical features. The results will be insightful for both wine producers and for people who drink wine regularly. This project can prevent individuals from getting a severe disease due to cosuming chemicals.
