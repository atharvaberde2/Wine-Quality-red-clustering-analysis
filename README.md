# Overview
In this project, clustering techniques are used to find patterns and groupings within wine quality data. This initiative aims to categorize wines into discrete quality clusters by examining their numerous chemical features. The results will be insightful for both wine producers and for people who drink wine regularly. This project can prevent individuals from getting a severe disease due to cosuming chemicals.

# Clustering Algorithms
Implemented various clustering algorithms, such as K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, to segment the wines. Utilized inertia to evaluate clustering performance. 

# Result
Using inertia as an evaluation metric was beneficial in identifying the optimal number of clusters, ensuring meaningful segmentation of the wines. Wine producers can use these clusters to better understand the elements that lead to higher quality ratings and to guide their decision-making process in order to enhance their offerings.
